description: Activating a high-street community in the City of Jyväskylä.
question: How do we facilitate collaboration across diverse stakeholders, and co-create shared visions and plans for our cities?
---

In the 1980s, Jyväskylä transformed its main-motorway into a pedestrian street, a bold, innovative step. From August to October 2021, we, alongside Tampere University, worked with the city to continue this tradition of high-street innovation. Together, we helped activate a community of high-street actors, with the purpose of enabling the street to thrive well into the future.

*The charette.*

The two-day Recentre Workshop centred around a charette. On the first day, we present cartographic analysis, invited experts to share analytical frames of reference, and engaged the high-street community in a tour and a charette. The charette revolved around three elements: manifesto, vision, and timeline. On the second day, the results of the charette were synthesised and put online on a purpose-built website, and we came together to celebrate the shared vision.
