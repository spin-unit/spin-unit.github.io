question: How to democratise participatory design?
---

Participatory design is at the core of Finnish urban design and it is considered a standard practice in urban development. The power of participatory processes can only be fully realised when participants are given a common, expressive language to reimagine the cities they live in.

*The charette.*

To improve and democratise urban design processes we need to bring get people, designers, and policy-makers talking to each other in one common language. To achieve that we partnered with [Toretei](https://toretei.com){:target="_blank"} to build UrbanistAI, a participatory design process facilitated by human AI.

The two-day Recentre Workshop centred around a charette. On the first day, we present cartographic analysis, invited experts to share analytical frames of reference, and engaged the high-street community in a tour and a charette. The charette revolved around three elements: manifesto, vision, and timeline. On the second day, the results of the charette were synthesised and put online on a purpose-built website, and we came together to celebrate the shared vision.
