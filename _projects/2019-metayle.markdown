description: A mobility study for the Rail Baltica terminal in Tallinn.
question: How to grow Ülemiste City sustainably?
---

Rail Baltica is the [5.8 billion euros](https://www.railbaltica.org/about-rail-baltica/finances/) project set to [connect the Baltic Countries](https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/ten-t/ten-t-projects/projects-by-priority-project/priority-project-27) in a straight line with the European rail network. Trains are expected to travel at 250km/h and carry between 4,7 and 7.1 million passengers in 2055. Tallinn will host the terminal station of the Rail Baltica in Ülemiste, an area that comprehends the Tallinn International Airport and the Ülemiste smart-city district.

By the time the Rail Baltica terminal will operate at nominal capacity, both the Tallinn Airport and Ülemiste city are expected to double in size. In this scenario of growth, a new mobility plan for the area was necessary to proceed with the approval of the development plan.

SPIN Unit led the mobility study and the scenario-making process to understand how to design a new plan to favour pedestrian movement and active mobility. A core aim of this project was to make public transit data meaningful for planners, investors and the real-estate development firms operating in the area.

From the study emerged that structural changes are needed to support the development of the district. The road infrastructure granting access to the new terminal is already saturated during peak hours, and the public transit system has already reached its capacity limits.

However, from the analysis of thick data gathered by surveys with more than 800 employees, we found that almost 95% of those driving would be willing to change mobility mode. Today only 22% commute using public transit, but they would be looking forward to switching to public transit if it was faster and offered more direct lines, and bicycles if there were more dedicated bike lanes.

The investment scenario we proposed focuses on directing resources towards the development of active mobility supported by local self-driving mobility solutions. Expanding the existing road network will induce demand for private vehicles that will hinder the expansion of the real-estate development that is possible to undertake in the area. The railway will act as a physical barrier between the different districts, so it will be pivotal to the plan to build as many linkages as possible underneath the rail tracks.

Public transport connections will require increased capacity and comfort to attract more users. This is even more important as EVs are poised to overcome the combustion engine. However, having more EVs will solve the pollution problem but not the required parking space. Public and private cooperation on the project is necessary to ensure a positive cumulative effect that improves citizens' everyday lives and brings positive social change - primarily to improve the modal split and the needed increase of biodiversity in the area.
